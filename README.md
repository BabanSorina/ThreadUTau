# threadUTau
ThreadUTau , a place where students are able to post in a thread about their desired topic like sport or events and even university related questions.
The user has to be a UTC-N student with a valid student ID provided by the university. 
If he/she wishes to use our app they have to register using the email mentioned.
After registering they are ready to read/post/comment on the thread for our topics: Sport, Travel, Events and University.

The front-end part of our project was made using Windows Forms 

We used a SQL database to store and work on the data we had.

We decided to use a web service to implement and store our methods for the application as it allows applications to communicate, exchange data, and shared services among themselves.
